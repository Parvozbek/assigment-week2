    <div class="div1"><p class="chikken">Chikkken</p><br><p>- Try wrapping your sushi rolling mat with
    cling film before you start rolling as this will not only make the mat easier
    to
    clean after using, but helps the sticky rice from getting stuck on the mat.
    - It is a good idea to have a bowl of water next to you when you are making makizushi as it is important to keep your
    fingers wet so that the rice doesn’t stick to them. It is also a good idea to keep the knife wet when you cut it to
    guarantee that you get a clean cut.
    - You can make what’s called an Uramaki roll, or an inside out roll. This is made with the nori on the inside and the
    rice on the outside of the roll. Uramaki is great sprinkled with roasted white sesame seeds.</p></div>
